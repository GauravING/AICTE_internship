This project aims to build a garbage classification system that can accurately identify and categorizes the waste images into the categories like cardboard, glass, paper, metal, plastic and trash. Using deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) .


# 🗑️ Garbage Classification System using EfficientNetV2-B2 (Transfer Learning)

This project implements a deep learning–based image classification system to automatically classify different types of garbage using **transfer learning** with **EfficientNetV2-B2**. The system is built with TensorFlow/Keras and aims to assist smart waste management systems with fast, accurate categorization of waste images.
